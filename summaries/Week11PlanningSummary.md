# Week 11 Planning Summary

## Retrospective

### Enjoyable
- We have finished collecting data for Nvidia, Wingstop, and Gamestop and have acquired most of the Dogecoin data. This was very satisfying as the web scraper had been a huge hurdle.
- We were able to complete the sentiment analysis for the social media data and have produced some nice visualizations.

### Frustrating
- Trying to get around Twitter's rate limits has been the biggest headache.
- Data pre-processing was a pain in the ass.

### Puzzling
- Nothing too puzzling; the way forward is pretty clear.

## Planning
1. Finish sentiment analysis for all data.
2. Produce more visualizations.
3. Perform regression and construct model(s).
4. Finish write-up and presentation slide deck.
