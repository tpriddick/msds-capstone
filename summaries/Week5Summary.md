# Week 5 Summary

## Retrospective

We mainly worked on starting to collect our data and develop our web scrapers. We made significant progress on building our Twitter web scraper using selenium. We also also determined the timelines that we are going to look at for analysis purposes. 

### Enjoyable

Researching timelines was enjoyable, as was familiarizing ourselves with selenium.

### Frustrating

Setting up a selenium webscraper is very difficult.

### Puzzling

Web scrapers. When searching for a term on Twitter, the search term is bolded in each tweet, making the html split up the text across multiple lines, so trying to figure out how to webscrape this will be a challenge.

## Planning

We plan on finishing building the Twitter web scraper and start collecting data for each of the 4 companies of interest. We will do further research to determine the amount of data we need to collect specifically with to regard to the number of posts per company per unit time. We also want to build and deploy a Reddit web scraper. If time permits, we also may want to scrape LinkedIn and Instagram, but that is not a top priority. All of our backlog items are still relevant.
