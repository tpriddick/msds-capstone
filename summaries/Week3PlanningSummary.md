# Week 3 Planning Summary

## The Inputs
We are coming into this week with our project brainstorming exercise from the previous week (iteration 2).

### The What
The goal of this iteration is to define a scope for our project based on our research question and the established research in this area. We only have a couple items in our backlog. One of these items is determining the final research question based on the current research, and the other is to start collecting relevant data.

### The How
We will do the research into data sources and also the work that has already been done in the industry.

### The Who
We are both assigned to these items, and we will meet at 5pm on Friday via Zoom to discuss our findings and flesh out our project proposal.

## The Outputs
The main goal of this iteration is to determine what exactly we want to accomplish with this project. We are coming into this with our brainstormed research questions and are choosing to focus on the questions from our third brainstorm item:  How can machine learning models predict the environmental impact of a company based on its historical data and public disclosures? What is the correlation between a company's carbon footprint and its stock performance over time? We will be spending our time exploring the research environment around these questions and determining what data sources we want to utilize. We are meeting this Friday, 5/31, at 5pm over Zoom to discuss findings and begin working on our proposal.
