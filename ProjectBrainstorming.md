**Research Question 2:** 
What are the factors that influence the success of start-ups at Y Combinator?

**Research Question 3:** 
How can machine learning models predict the environmental impact of a company based on its historical data and public disclosures? What is the correlation between a company's carbon footprint and its stock performance over time?

**Research Question 4:** 
What is the impact of loyalty programs on customer satisfaction and retention rates in the retail industry, and which features of loyalty programs are most effective in enhancing customer loyalty?

**Research Question 5:** 
Can we predict when and where people will immigrate based on predictive features? 

## 3. Project Proposals
For each research question, propose a data science project.

### Project Proposal 1
**Research Question: When does a video game peak in popularity and how can a publisher use player churn to determine when to release new content?** 


**Project Title: Optimizing Content Release Timing Through Analysis of Video Game Popularity and Player Churn** 


**Description: This project would aim to analyze the lifecycle of video game popularity and determine how player churn rates can inform optimal timing for releasing new content. By understanding when an online game such as Fortnite or Apex Legends peaks in popularity and identifying patterns in player retention and departure, game publishers can plan content updates to maximize engagement and prolong the game's lifespan. The end goal is to develop a predictive model that assists publishers in making data-driven decisions regarding content release schedules.**


**Data Sources: Game Analytics Platforms,Sales and download data, third-party APIs**


**Methods: Survival Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Validation and Testing**


### Project Proposal 2
**Research Question: What are the factors that influence the success of start-ups at Y Combinator?** 


**Project Title: Identifying Key Success Factors for Start-ups at Y Combinator and Trends Over Time** 


**Description: This project would aim to identify and analyze the factors that contribute to the success of start-ups admitted to Y Combinator (YC). By examining various aspects such as founder demographics, business models, funding amounts, industry sectors, and more, we would aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can help predict which start-ups are more likely to succeed. The end goal is to provide actionable insights and a general guide for reference for aspiring startup founders and investors.**


**Data Sources: Y Combinator Database, CrunchBase, AngelList, TechCrunch, and VentureBeat.**


**Methods: Feature Engineering, Statistical Analysis, Clustering and Segmenting**


### Project Proposal 3
**Research Question: How can machine learning models predict the environmental impact of a company based on its historical data and public disclosures? What is the correlation between a company's carbon footprint and its stock performance over time?** 


**Project Title: Predicting Environmental Impact and Analyzing the Correlation with Stock Performance Using Machine Learning** 


**Description: This project would aim to develop machine learning models to predict a company's environmental impact, specifically its carbon footprint, using historical envronment (ESG) data and public disclosures. Additionally, the project will try to explore the correlation between a company's carbon footprint and its stock performance over time. The end goal is to gain insights into how environmental sustainability affects financial performance (if any?) and to create tools for investors and companies to assess and improve their environmental impact.**


**Data Sources: EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), Company Disclosures, Third-Pary Analytics**


**Methods: Feature Engineering, Predictive Regression Models, Correlation Analysis, Clustering**


### Project Proposal 4
**Research Question: What is the impact of loyalty programs on customer satisfaction and retention rates in the retail industry, and which features of loyalty programs are most effective in enhancing customer loyalty?** 


**Project Title: Evaluating the Impact of Loyalty Programs on Customer Satisfaction and Retention in Retail** 


**Description: This project would aim to assess how loyalty programs influence customer satisfaction and retention rates in the retail industry. Project would analyze various features of loyalty programs to determine which are most effective in fostering customer loyalty. By leveraging customer data and feedback, the project would seek to identify good practices and provide recommendations for designing loyalty programs that maximize customer engagement and retention.**


**Data Sources: Retailer Databases, Market Research Reports**


**Methods: Survival Analysis, A/B Testing, Sentiment Analysis, Machine Learning Models, Segementation**


### Project Proposal 5
**Research Question: Can we predict when and where people will immigrate based on predictive features?** 


**Project Title: Predicting Immigration Patterns Using Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics** 


**Description: This project would aim to develop predictive models to forecast when and where people are likely to immigrate based on a variety of demographic, economic, social, and geo-political factors. By leveraging historical immigration data and external factors, the project would aim to identify key predictors of migration patterns and build  models to understand and anticipate immigration trends.**


**Data Sources: UN Migration, CIA World Factbook, World Bank, Economic Indicators (GDP), Social Indicators (GINI), Global Peace Index, Environmental Data**


**Methods: Feature Engineering, Predictive Modeling, Scenario Analysis**


## 4. Top 3 Project Rankings


### 1. Top Project
**Project Title: Predicting Environmental Impact and Analyzing the Correlation with Stock Performance Using Machine Learning** 


**Research Question: How can machine learning models predict the environmental impact of a company based on its historical data and public disclosures? What is the correlation between a company's carbon footprint and its stock performance over time?** 


**Reason for Ranking: It is at crossoroads of our interests and we think data would be easier to gather than the other options.**


### 2. Second Project
**Project Title: Evaluating the Impact of Loyalty Programs on Customer Satisfaction and Retention in Retail** 


**Research Question: What is the impact of loyalty programs on customer satisfaction and retention rates in the retail industry, and which features of loyalty programs are most effective in enhancing customer loyalty?** 

**Reason for Ranking: Very interesting business question with possible significant outcomes. Ranked second only because data might be harder to get.**


### 3. Third Project
**Project Title: Optimizing Content Release Timing Through Analysis of Video Game Popularity and Player Churn** 


**Research Question: When does a video game peak in popularity and how can a publisher use player churn to determine when to release new content?** 


**Reason for Ranking: It was a hard choice between this and immigration project. But this one has much clearer applications visible to us.**


## 5. Conclusion
**Summary: Key points from Brainstorming:
- We would like to explore an idea and build a project around it which is of a mutual interest with significant business application and possible positive impact in general.
- We agreed a project with business application would be a great addition to our resumes as we would be able to demonstrate capability of identifying, tackling, and solving a problem in business setting.
- We ranked projects on the basis of a combination of factors which includes our interest + business application + ease of data availability.**

Summarize the key points from your brainstorming session and the rationale behind your rankings.

**NOTE: For the methods section of each project, we assumed that data collection and processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interpretation/reporting are standard operating procedures common to all projects. Therefore, we did not mention these methods separately for each project.**
